# SVG-Logo-Maker
About: This application helps make logos.

Description: The application allows the user to put in the color, shape, and text color of their logo.

Challenges: The challenges I had were getting the logos to come up the right way and running the tests.

Future Development: For future development I would like to add more shapes to choose from.

Motivation: My motivation was to make an application that where people can make their own logos exactly how they want them.

Success: I was able to get the questions to come up when running the code in the command line.

Contributors: I used code from our class activities and then changed the information to go with my application.
